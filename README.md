Yale S&amp;DS 492 Senior Project: Factors of Violence in Mexico and its Effect on the Economy


This is my Senior Project to fulfill my B.A. in Statistics and Data Science at Yale University.

In this project, I aim to answer a series of questions regarding factors that affect violence driven by the drug cartels in different regions of Mexico, the effect of violence in the economic development of the country, and explore the phenomenon that causes cartels to collude and fight against each other in an unregulated market.

More information on the specific questions and the data sets used to answer the questions can be found in the Project_Aims_Goals.md file in this project.

I hope you find these findings useful and feel free to reach out to me through the following email for any questions you may have: `jeronimofueyo@gmail.com`
